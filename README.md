# Build25 BRK225 - Bring your own model to Windows using Windows ML Runtime

## Description

Windows ML empowers you to bring your own model, or pick from our growing Foundry catalog, and helps you optimize your AI workload across CPU/GPU/NPU, all while streamlining model & runtime dependency management.

This repo shows you how to use Windows ML in csharp, cpp and python. It contains the ResnetBuildDemo app that we showed in our demo, and a couple of other cs, cpp and python samples.
